# Problem Statement
Users have many accounts and struggle to remember strong passwords. They need a small utility to store account passwords securely and retrieve them as needed.

# Scope of the Project
- Provide a console-based password manager for educational/demonstration purposes.
- Allow password generation and a minimal substitution-based encryption for stored passwords.
- Provide documentation and a modular project structure for clarity and learning.

# Target Users
- Students learning basic Python program structure.
- Developers learning how to structure a small script into modules.
- Anyone wanting a simple demo password manager (not for production use).

# High-level Features
- Master password setup and verification.
- Add account entries with an encrypted password.
- Retrieve entries and optionally decrypt them for use.
- Optional random password generation.
